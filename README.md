# Voodoo
The source code for the not-so-well-known Minecraft Voodoo Plugin!
## Game
Minecraft Voodoo is a new 1 vs 1 type game mode for Minecraft 1.16!
Play as a Hex against a friend and beat them in a challenge of wits and witchcraft!
## Gameplay Instructions
### Goal
The goal of this game is to kill your opponent using your witchcraft, the environment or sheer luck.
No matter the cause, last man standing wins!
### Rules
- PvP between Hexes is disabled. This means they cannot deal direct damage to eachother using bows, swords etc.
- Using the environment to slay your opponent is a valid strategy and is highly recommended.
- A safe zone should be created on the map that consists of a 10x10 area of bedrock on the world spawn. This is to prevent spawn-traps.
### Witchcraft
The plugin allows the crafting of multiple Witchcraft scrolls. These scrolls will be useable once a match between two hexes start.
Scrolls can be saved up and chained together to make more powerful Witchcraft interactions!
The following Witchcraft has been implemented with the following recipes:
| Name  | Description | Recipe |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Transplace  | Switch places with the other Hex  | 1 Diamond block |

## Additional Info
- This Plugin is tested on Minecraft Version 1.6. Other Minecraft versions are currently not tested.
- Nether could either be enabled or disabled, it does not affect the plugin.
- Mobs should be turned ON, when playing this plugin. (Normal - Hard difficulty recommended.)
- All recipes can be crafted in the crafting table, EXCEPT for Crumble, this scroll could be made holding an item and using the /Voodoo crumble command. (Therefore the Voodoo can be made optional.)
- The game mode is designed and tested for 1 vs 1 interactions. Adding more than 2 Hexes might result in unexpected behaviour.
- If you want to test the effects of the Voodoo in singleplayer the /Voodoo debug command could be run to override the start conditions. All voodoo will  then be cast on the caster.

## Installation
Just drag the .jar file into the plugins folder on your Minecraft server, restart and you're good to go!
